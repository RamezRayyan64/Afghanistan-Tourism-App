                'Herat is the second largest city in Afghanistan, located in the north western part of Afghanistan. It is famous as Nagin Aseeya or Diamond of Asia in some literature. The city has a history of more than 3000 years. History of this city is very eventful. It was destroyed and rebuilt many times. After the fall of the communist government in Afghanistan in the early 1990s, the city changed its face due to development by Ismail Khan (Amir Ismail Khan), a local Jihadi Commander who ruled Herat till the takeover by the Taliban. Ismail Khan became the governor of this province again after the fall of Taliban and the establishment of the Karzai Government. He has continued to build on his earlier works. The people are very friendly and hospitable to foreigners and are also more religious than people in Kabul. Most of the young understand some English and occasionally other foreign languages. It is comparatively safer than some other provinces of Afghanistan.',
